<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
RACES Training's purpose is to compare the RACES Training Spreadsheet (google sheet) to the RACES 
database (MS Access database).  It reports the discrepancies between the two sets of data and
attempts to alert the user of updates that need to be made in the database.  Here is the list
of comparisons made for each user in the training spreadsheet:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Badge Training completed and BadgeOK not set in database</li>
<li>Badge Training not completed and BadgeOK set in database</li>
<li>
Spreadsheet has no responder date and Responder Training not completed but marked as a responder in the database
</li>
<li>Spreadsheet has a responder date and the Responder Training not completed</li>
<li>
Spreadsheet has a responder date and the database is not marked as a responder
Responder Training has been completed but the database is not marked as a responder
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition to a message about each of these differences the percentage completion of the 
Responder training is computed and output.  It is based only on a count of the number of items
completed in the set of 16 items.
</p>
<p>
Two additional commands are available to show which training elements are needed the most.  They
are the Non-Responder Training Needed and the Legacy Responder Training Needed commands.
</p>
<p>
See the Operations Page for details of each operation.  Once a database has been opened it is
automatically opened when the application is started.  There is a button to change the database
to open.  The spreadsheet exists on the web and a csv file may be downloaded from it.  This
csv file is then loaded into the application.  There is a command to perform the comparison and
it may be printed using the print command.
